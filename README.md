# Automotive Vulnerability Database

This repository contains a dataset of 508 automotive cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified from two primary sources: the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and the [Automotive Attack Database (AAD)](https://github.com/IEEM-HsKA/AAD). The dataset is presented in an Excel sheet and provides an overview of vulnerabilities relevant to automotive systems, classified according to impact categories defined in the ISO/SAE 21434 standard (safety, financial, operational, and privacy).

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes vulnerabilities reported from **2002 to 2024**, and data has been curated to focus specifically on automotive cybersecurity. This database is designed as a resource for researchers, cybersecurity experts, and automotive professionals interested in understanding the risks posed by various vulnerabilities in connected vehicles.

### Key Features:
- **508 vulnerabilities** from NVD and AAD sources.
- Classified by impact categories (Safety, Financial, Operational, Privacy).
- Filtered for systemic risks with remote exploitability.
- Includes attack vectors, CVSS scores, and vulnerability descriptions.
  
## Companion to Conference Submission

This dataset accompanies the manuscript submitted to the **16th International Conference on Global Security, Safety & Sustainability (ICGS3)** in the UK. The manuscript details the methodology used to identify, classify, and analyze these vulnerabilities, and provides insights into systemic risks within connected vehicle ecosystems.
